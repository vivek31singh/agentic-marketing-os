    "Initialize the Next.js 14+ project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration. This includes creating `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and the root `app/layout.tsx` to establish the basic HTML structure and global font settings.",
    "Create the `data/mockData.ts` file containing the TypeScript interfaces for Workspace, Module, Thread, Agent, Event, and Conflict, along with sample mock data (e.g., a \"TechStart\" workspace with modules like \"SEO_Cluster\" and \"Content_Factory\") to support the upcoming UI implementation.",
    "Implement the Workspace Shell architecture. This involves creating the layout components for the Left Sidebar (Navigation), Top Bar, and Right Rail, and integrating them into the `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/layout.tsx` file to establish the routing structure and persistent UI elements.",
    "Implement Phase 2: Design System & Core UI Components. This involves creating `lib/theme.ts` for design tokens, building a library of primitives in `components/ui` (Button, Card, Badge, MetricStat, Tag, Avatar, ProgressBar, Accordion), and refactoring `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/layout.tsx` and `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/page.tsx` to utilize these new components for a cohesive look and feel.",
    "Fix design system configuration and component consistency. Update `tailwind.config.ts` to properly import and apply the theme configuration from `lib/theme.ts`. Standardize the color naming convention by aligning the theme and components (resolving the \"danger\" vs \"error\" mismatch), and refactor the `Badge` component to utilize `forwardRef` for API consistency.",
    "Implement the Mission Control Dashboard view in `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/page.tsx`. Use the `mockData` to populate the workspace details. Create a layout that features a header section for the workspace status and a grid of `Card` components displaying key system metrics (e.g., 'Active Threads', 'System Health', 'Active Agents') using the `MetricStat` component, and a list of accessible modules (e.g., SEO_Cluster, Content_Factory) using `Badge` and `Button` components.",
    "Implement the Mission Control Dashboard at `/app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/mission-control/page.tsx` and create the associated mock data in `/data/missionControl.ts`. The dashboard must feature a header with status chips, a row of `MetricStat` components (System Health, Pending Actions, etc.), a grid of `Card` components for Domain Snapshots (Business_Audit, SEO_Cluster, etc.), and a preview section for Active Threads.",
    "Implement the SEO Cluster Module page at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/seo-cluster/page.tsx`. This page should render a list of active threads relevant to SEO (using the `Thread` interface), display SEO-specific metrics (e.g., Crawl Health, Indexed Pages) using `MetricStat` and `Card` components, and provide navigation to specific thread details. Create or extend mock data in `data/seoCluster.ts` to populate this view.",
    "Implement the Thread Detail View. This involves creating the page template at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/[moduleSlug]/[threadSlug]/page.tsx` and developing the necessary domain components to display the thread's objective, a timeline of events (messages, system logs), and interactive conflict resolution panels. Additionally, create specific mock data for a sample thread that includes a conflict scenario to demonstrate the UI's interactive capabilities.",
    "Implement the Content Factory Module page at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/content-factory/page.tsx` and generate the supporting mock data in `data/contentFactory.ts`. The page should feature a header section, content-specific metrics (e.g., \"Content Velocity\", \"Pending Approval\") using the `MetricStat` component, and a list or grid of active content threads using `Card`, `Badge`, and `Button` components.",
    "Implement the Social Growth Module page at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/social-growth/page.tsx` and generate the supporting mock data in `data/socialGrowth.ts`. The page should feature a header section, social-specific metrics (e.g., \"Viral Potential\", \"Trend Alerts\") using the `MetricStat` component, and a list or grid of active social threads (e.g., Trend Analysis, Influencer Outreach) using `Card`, `Badge`, and `Button` components.",
    "Refactor the SEO Cluster (`app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/seo-cluster/page.tsx`) and Content Factory (`app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/content-factory/page.tsx`) pages to support interactivity. Specifically:\n1. Convert these pages or their interactive sections into Client Components.\n2. Implement `useState` to handle Conflict Panel logic (highlighting \"Selected\" option when users click Approve).\n3. Implement `useState` to handle Recovery/Error actions (updating UI text/status for \"Retry\", \"Auto-Fix\", and \"Ignore\" buttons).\n4. Ensure visual feedback (loading states, success text) is applied immediately upon interaction.",
    "Implement the SaaS Launch Ops Module page at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/saas-launch-ops/page.tsx` and generate the supporting mock data in `data/saasLaunchOps.ts`. The page should feature a header section, specific metrics relevant to SaaS launches (e.g., \"Launch Readiness\", \"Asset Approval Queue\") using the `MetricStat` component, and a list or grid of active threads (e.g., \"Go-To-Market Strategy\", \"Q1 Asset Review\") using `Card`, `Badge`, and `Button` components.",
    "Implement the Workspace Settings page at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/settings/page.tsx`. This includes creating a UI for managing General Information (name, status), Integrations (connected services like OpenAI, Slack), and Guardrails (budget limits, approval thresholds). Mock data for these settings should be created in `data/workspaceSettings.ts`, and the page should utilize existing UI primitives (Card, Button, Badge, inputs) to maintain design consistency.",
    "Update `components/ui/Badge.tsx` to add the missing \"outline\" and \"ghost\" variants to the `badgeVariants` definition and update the `withDot` conditional logic to correctly assign dot colors for these new variants.",
    "Refactor the Social Growth Module (`app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/social-growth/page.tsx`) and SaaS Launch Ops Module (`app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/saas-launch-ops/page.tsx`) to be fully interactive. This involves converting relevant sections to Client Components and implementing `useState` handlers for Conflict Resolution (selecting/approving options) and Recovery Actions (handling Retry, Auto-Fix, and Ignore clicks with visual feedback), matching the functionality of the SEO and Content modules.",
    "Implement the \"Send Command\" functionality in the Thread Detail View. This involves ensuring the Thread Detail page (or a dedicated input component within it) is a Client Component, adding a text input field and submit button, and implementing state logic to append a new user `Event` to the thread's timeline upon submission.",
    "Update `components/ui/Badge.tsx` to add the missing \"outline\" and \"ghost\" variants, fix the `dotColorMap` type constraint, and update the `withDot` conditional logic to handle these new variants. Additionally, update `components/ui/Tag.tsx` to add the missing \"outline\" variant.",
    "Implement Agent Scorecards for the Right Rail. Create a new `components/domains/AgentScorecard.tsx` component to display agent details (name, role, avatar) and key metrics (Accuracy, Latency). Integrate this component into the `RightRail` layout (or specific page contexts like Mission Control and Thread Details) to show active agents and their performance statistics based on the mock data.",
    "Implement View Toggles (Standard, Logic, Debug) for the Thread Detail view. This involves creating a segmented control or tab switcher in the `ThreadDetail` page header, managing the active view state, and updating the `ThreadTimeline` or `Event` components to conditionally render the `logicChain` (for Logic view) and `meta` details (for Debug view) based on the selected mode.",
    "Execute critical codebase fixes to resolve TypeScript errors and inconsistencies. This involves: 1) Correcting import names in the SEO Cluster (to `mockSEOThreads`, `mockSEOMetrics`) and Social Growth (to `socialThreads`) pages. 2) Updating the Badge component to include missing \"outline\" and \"ghost\" variants and fixing the `dotColorMap` type constraint. 3) Adding explicit type annotations to resolve implicit 'any' errors. 4) Standardizing all \"danger\" color references to \"error\" to match the theme system.",
    "Implement the Root Landing Page (`app/page.tsx`) to display a list of available workspaces and provide navigation links to specific workspace IDs.",
    "Implement the Modal UI Primitive (`components/ui/Modal.tsx`).",
    "Refactor the Mission Control Dashboard to implement the new design specifications. This involves:\n1. Updating `data/missionControl.ts` to include the detailed mock data for status pills, KPI trends, domain health details, active thread lists, and the live agent activity feed.\n2. Rewriting `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/mission-control/page.tsx` to structure the page into: a top header bar, a row of KPI summary cards, and a bottom grid split into \"Domain Health\" (top-left), \"Active Threads\" (bottom-left), and \"Live Agent Activity\" (right column), applying the specific Tailwind styling and responsive rules defined in the brief.",
    "Implement `components/ui/Skeleton.tsx` and `components/ui/EmptyState.tsx` components.",
    "Implement Next.js Loading and Error Boundaries. Create `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/loading.tsx`, `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/error.tsx`, and `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/mission-control/loading.tsx`. These files should utilize the `Skeleton` component to mimic the layout structure (Sidebar, MetricStats, Cards) and the `EmptyState` component for error displays, ensuring the application remains responsive and informative during data fetching or runtime failures.",
    "Refactor `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/mission-control/page.tsx` to implement the new Kanban-style Mission Control Board. This involves:\n1. Creating new sub-components: `BoardHeader` (with workspace switcher and status), `BoardInsightsStrip` (KPIs as chips), `DomainHealthChips`, `KanbanBoard` (with columns for Inbox, In Progress, Review, Blocked, Done), `KanbanCard` (thread cards with domain/status/priority), and `LiveActivityRail` (right-side timeline).\n2. Updating the page layout to a two-column structure (Board on left, Activity Rail on right) with the new header and insights strip at the top.\n3. Applying the \"calm, card-based\" styling using Tailwind CSS (soft borders, rounded corners, slate/emerald/amber/rose tints).",
    "Implement Loading and Error Boundaries for all specific Module routes. This involves creating `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` files within the `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/[moduleSlug]/` directories. These files should utilize the existing `Skeleton` and `EmptyState` primitives to mimic the structure of the module pages (headers, metric stats, thread lists), providing a seamless transition experience during navigation and data fetching.",
    "Implement Loading and Error Boundaries for Thread Detail Views. Create `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/[moduleSlug]/[threadSlug]/loading.tsx` and `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/[moduleSlug]/[threadSlug]/error.tsx` using the existing `Skeleton` and `EmptyState` primitives. These files should mimic the layout of the Thread Detail page, including the header (status pills, view toggles), the timeline section (skeleton lines for messages/events), and the conflict panel area.",
    "Fix the `cn is not defined` error by adding the missing import statement `import { cn } from \"@/lib/utils\";` to `components/domains/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx`. Additionally, verify and fix similar missing imports in other recently created components within the `components/domains/kanban/` directory (such as `BoardHeader.tsx`, `LiveActivityRail.tsx`, and `KanbanCard.tsx`) to ensure the entire Kanban implementation functions correctly.",
    "Fix the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')` in `components/domains/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx`. This involves verifying the component's prop interface to ensure `items` is defined, ensuring the parent component (`app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/mission-control/page.tsx`) passes the thread data as the `items` prop, and adding a default empty array fallback to prevent future crashes if data is missing.",
    "Fix the data export error in `data/missionControl.ts` and the corresponding import in `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/mission-control/page.tsx` to resolve the import error and ensure valid thread data is passed to the Kanban board.",
    "Implement Loading and Error Boundaries for the Workspace Settings page. Create `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/settings/loading.tsx` and `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/settings/error.tsx`. These files should utilize the existing `Skeleton` component to mimic the layout of the Settings page (headers, form inputs/cards for General/Integrations/Guardrails) and the `EmptyState` component for error displays, ensuring the application remains responsive and informative during navigation to the settings view."
