    "Initialize the Next.js 14+ project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration. This includes creating `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and the root `app/layout.tsx` to establish the basic HTML structure and global font settings.",
    "Create the `data/mockData.ts` file containing the TypeScript interfaces for Workspace, Module, Thread, Agent, Event, and Conflict, along with sample mock data (e.g., a \"TechStart\" workspace with modules like \"SEO_Cluster\" and \"Content_Factory\") to support the upcoming UI implementation.",
    "Implement the Workspace Shell architecture. This involves creating the layout components for the Left Sidebar (Navigation), Top Bar, and Right Rail, and integrating them into the `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/layout.tsx` file to establish the routing structure and persistent UI elements."

  "last_commit": "feat: implement Workspace Shell architecture with layout components\n\nCreate the persistent workspace shell layout consisting of LeftNav (sidebar navigation), TopBar (header), and RightRail (context-aware sidebar). Integrate these components into the workspace-specific layout at app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/layout.tsx to establish the foundational UI structure for all workspace pages.\n\nComponents created:\n- LeftNav: Displays workspace info, module navigation with active thread counts, and user profile\n- TopBar: Contains page title, search input, and action buttons (notifications, help)\n- RightRail: Shows active agents with metrics, recent activity timeline, and system health\n- Workspace layout: Integrates all three components in a responsive flex layout"
