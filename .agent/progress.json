    "Initialize the Next.js 14+ project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration. This includes creating `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and the root `app/layout.tsx` to establish the basic HTML structure and global font settings.",
    "Create the `data/mockData.ts` file containing the TypeScript interfaces for Workspace, Module, Thread, Agent, Event, and Conflict, along with sample mock data (e.g., a \"TechStart\" workspace with modules like \"SEO_Cluster\" and \"Content_Factory\") to support the upcoming UI implementation.",
    "Implement the Workspace Shell architecture. This involves creating the layout components for the Left Sidebar (Navigation), Top Bar, and Right Rail, and integrating them into the `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/layout.tsx` file to establish the routing structure and persistent UI elements.",
    "Implement Phase 2: Design System & Core UI Components. This involves creating `lib/theme.ts` for design tokens, building a library of primitives in `components/ui` (Button, Card, Badge, MetricStat, Tag, Avatar, ProgressBar, Accordion), and refactoring `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/layout.tsx` and `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/page.tsx` to utilize these new components for a cohesive look and feel.",
    "Fix design system configuration and component consistency. Update `tailwind.config.ts` to properly import and apply the theme configuration from `lib/theme.ts`. Standardize the color naming convention by aligning the theme and components (resolving the \"danger\" vs \"error\" mismatch), and refactor the `Badge` component to utilize `forwardRef` for API consistency."
