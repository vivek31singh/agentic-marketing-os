    "Initialize the Next.js 14+ project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration. This includes creating `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and the root `app/layout.tsx` to establish the basic HTML structure and global font settings.",
    "Create the `data/mockData.ts` file containing the TypeScript interfaces for Workspace, Module, Thread, Agent, Event, and Conflict, along with sample mock data (e.g., a \"TechStart\" workspace with modules like \"SEO_Cluster\" and \"Content_Factory\") to support the upcoming UI implementation.",
    "Implement the Workspace Shell architecture. This involves creating the layout components for the Left Sidebar (Navigation), Top Bar, and Right Rail, and integrating them into the `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/layout.tsx` file to establish the routing structure and persistent UI elements.",
    "Implement Phase 2: Design System & Core UI Components. This involves creating `lib/theme.ts` for design tokens, building a library of primitives in `components/ui` (Button, Card, Badge, MetricStat, Tag, Avatar, ProgressBar, Accordion), and refactoring `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/layout.tsx` and `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/page.tsx` to utilize these new components for a cohesive look and feel.",
    "Fix design system configuration and component consistency. Update `tailwind.config.ts` to properly import and apply the theme configuration from `lib/theme.ts`. Standardize the color naming convention by aligning the theme and components (resolving the \"danger\" vs \"error\" mismatch), and refactor the `Badge` component to utilize `forwardRef` for API consistency.",
    "Implement the Mission Control Dashboard view in `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/page.tsx`. Use the `mockData` to populate the workspace details. Create a layout that features a header section for the workspace status and a grid of `Card` components displaying key system metrics (e.g., 'Active Threads', 'System Health', 'Active Agents') using the `MetricStat` component, and a list of accessible modules (e.g., SEO_Cluster, Content_Factory) using `Badge` and `Button` components.",
    "Implement the Mission Control Dashboard at `/app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/mission-control/page.tsx` and create the associated mock data in `/data/missionControl.ts`. The dashboard must feature a header with status chips, a row of `MetricStat` components (System Health, Pending Actions, etc.), a grid of `Card` components for Domain Snapshots (Business_Audit, SEO_Cluster, etc.), and a preview section for Active Threads.",
    "Implement the SEO Cluster Module page at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/seo-cluster/page.tsx`. This page should render a list of active threads relevant to SEO (using the `Thread` interface), display SEO-specific metrics (e.g., Crawl Health, Indexed Pages) using `MetricStat` and `Card` components, and provide navigation to specific thread details. Create or extend mock data in `data/seoCluster.ts` to populate this view.",
    "Implement the Thread Detail View. This involves creating the page template at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/[moduleSlug]/[threadSlug]/page.tsx` and developing the necessary domain components to display the thread's objective, a timeline of events (messages, system logs), and interactive conflict resolution panels. Additionally, create specific mock data for a sample thread that includes a conflict scenario to demonstrate the UI's interactive capabilities.",
    "Implement the Content Factory Module page at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/content-factory/page.tsx` and generate the supporting mock data in `data/contentFactory.ts`. The page should feature a header section, content-specific metrics (e.g., \"Content Velocity\", \"Pending Approval\") using the `MetricStat` component, and a list or grid of active content threads using `Card`, `Badge`, and `Button` components.",
    "Implement the Social Growth Module page at `app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/social-growth/page.tsx` and generate the supporting mock data in `data/socialGrowth.ts`. The page should feature a header section, social-specific metrics (e.g., \"Viral Potential\", \"Trend Alerts\") using the `MetricStat` component, and a list or grid of active social threads (e.g., Trend Analysis, Influencer Outreach) using `Card`, `Badge`, and `Button` components.",
    "Refactor the SEO Cluster (`app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/seo-cluster/page.tsx`) and Content Factory (`app/workspaces/[workspaceId]/modules/content-factory/page.tsx`) pages to support interactivity. Specifically:\n1. Convert these pages or their interactive sections into Client Components.\n2. Implement `useState` to handle Conflict Panel logic (highlighting \"Selected\" option when users click Approve).\n3. Implement `useState` to handle Recovery/Error actions (updating UI text/status for \"Retry\", \"Auto-Fix\", and \"Ignore\" buttons).\n4. Ensure visual feedback (loading states, success text) is applied immediately upon interaction."

  "last_commit": "feat: add interactivity to SEO Cluster and Content Factory pages\n\n- Convert pages to Client Components with 'use client' directive\n- Implement useState for Conflict Panel selection logic with \"Selected\" badge\n- Implement useState for Recovery/Error actions (Retry, Auto-Fix, Ignore)\n- Add loading states with spinning icons for async actions\n- Add success states with CheckCircle icons for completed actions\n- Provide immediate visual feedback on all user interactions"
